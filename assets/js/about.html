<h1>Welcome to TigerTalk!</h1>
<p>TigerTalk is a web-app designed to facilitate campus discussion across Princetonâ€™s student body. Inspired by websites such as Quora, Reddit and RealTalk Princeton, TigerTalk will allow users to post text entries, questions and discussion topics to generate campus conversation. These posts could be anything from a question about possible fall courses to student opinions on an upcoming referendum and can be tagged to allow for easy searching. Posts can be replied to by other students in a comment thread, allowing for a range of student voices across campus to be heard and these posts and replies can be upvoted or downvoted, sorted by top posts as well as searched. </p>

<p> Users will be anonymous on the front end to other users and will be labelled using a number such as #123 that can be referenced by users who wish to comment on the post or mention it in other posts. However, users will be required to log into TigerTalk using their Princeton credentials so that they can be identified in cases of serious university violations. The majority of posts, nevertheless, will be community moderated whereby if a post receives a certain number of downvotes, it will be removed. Posts or comments can also be flagged by other users in which case, they would have to undergo review. After a certain number of days have past, posts will be automatically deleted. </p>

<p>The goal of TigerTalk would be to provide a platform where the Princeton student body can come together to share their experiences and opinions, allowing for increased mentorship, a stronger campus community as well as a better understanding of where the student body stands on certain issues. </p>
